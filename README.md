# BreastCancer
This is a consulting project I did for Isono health ( Unfortunately, I cannot share the data and code due to NDA)
This was a deep learning project built to automatically detect and predict the presence of breast cancer lesions on  ultrasound images an advaced type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) known as You Only Look Once (YOLO v5).  The outcome of the project will be deployed in the production of portable ultrasound machines to help reduce inequalities in diagnosis of breast cancer by improving access to diagnostic tool at low cost, significantly reducing time and number of hospital visits.
