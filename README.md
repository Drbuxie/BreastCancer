# BreastCancer
This is a consulting project I did for Isono health ( Unfortunately, I cannot share the data and code due to NDA)
This was a deep learning project built to automatically detect and predict the presence of breast cancer lesions on ultrasound images an advanced type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) known as You Only Look Once (YOLO v5).  The outcome of the project will be deployed in the production of portable ultrasound machines to help reduce inequalities in the diagnosis of breast cancer by improving access to diagnostic tools at a low cost, significantly reducing time and number of hospital visits.
